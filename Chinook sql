--Here are some examples that I have done 

--#1.Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM Chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

--#2.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT Cust.FirstName, Cust.LastName, Invo.InvoiceId, Invo.InvoiceDate, Invo.BillingCountry
FROM Chinook.invoices AS Invo
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers AS cust
ON Invo.CustomerId = Cust.CustomerId
Where Invo.BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

--#3.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

--#4.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--#5.How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE Invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--#6.What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE Invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';
